# BillMate

## Overview

BillMate is a React.js web application designed to simplify the process of generating professional invoices as PDF documents. It provides an intuitive user interface for users to enter invoice details, including client information, services provided, and payment terms. The app then generates a downloadable PDF invoice based on the input data.

## Features

- Dynamic Service Items: Users can add and remove service items dynamically, making it easy to create invoices with multiple line items.

- PDF Generation: The app utilizes the pdf-lib library to generate PDF invoices with all the entered information.

- Customization: Users can customize various invoice details, such as VAT, payment terms, currency, and more.

- Convenient Embedding: Once generated, the PDF invoice is embedded within the app, making it easy for users to preview and download.
